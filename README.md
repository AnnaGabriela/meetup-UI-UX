NEWS:

Soon we will be launching the Women Dev Projects initiative - aim to develop pro-bonos and commercial projects to put into practice the knowledge in meetups and study groups. Opportunity to acquire professional experience with real projects. We believe that with the creation of an own portfolio professionals gain more visibility and increase their competitiveness in the market. For commercial services a% will be donated to the community, being reverted to courses, books, coffeebreaks and conferences for members and encouraging female entrepreneurship.

Anyway, this meetup is already part of the process of this initiative and the goal is to align the knowledge, we prepare, because we will certainly have real projects to develop, so the idea is to train dev teams and designers for the opportunities that will arise .
